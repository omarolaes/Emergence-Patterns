# Growing Organisms

Interactive Three.js and GSAP scene that represents the growth and development of life forms using 3D shapes and animations. 

## Project Overview

At its core, Growing Organisms is built around a simple yet captivating concept: generating 3D text that sprouts dynamic and interactive 3D shapes. As you move your mouse over the text, you'll see these shapes spring to life, creating an organic experience.

As the project evolves, we plan to incorporate mathematical and biological formulas to create more realistic and complex life forms.
